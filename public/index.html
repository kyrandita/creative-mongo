  <h1>Collaborative story writing</h1>
  <p>Create a new Story starter, or expand one already here to see what's already been written. Keep additions small if you would so people can branch off how they like. Eventually I'd like to add the ability to completely hide branches to avoid other sentences spilling into your narrative if you aren't working on the first child of any branch... but this version doesn't have that yet</p>
